This is the documentation for using the MAST data catalog. MAST stands for the [Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Ampere_Spherical_Tokamak). This site provides documentation for accessing historical data and meta data from MAST. Here you can find descriptions and examples of
the how to use the different APIs and endpoints that we provide for accessing data from MAST.
