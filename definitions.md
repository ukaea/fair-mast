# Definitions

A "good" shot is a shot that satisfies the following conditions:

- the time duration of the useful plasma phase (usually, but not necessarily, the flat top) is sufficient for the goals of the experiment, or is cut short by instabilities that are intrinsic to the scenario chosen and thus unavoidable
- the vacuum toroidal magnetic field, the plasma current and the line-averaged density are within 2%, 5% and 25% of the request, respectively
- the auxiliary power from the neutral beam box is within 20% of the request
- all diagnostics and gas delivery systems deemed obligatory for the experiment (in addition to those offered as "standard") are operating in a satisfactory manner, without significant saturation, data loss or other malfunction

A "failed" shot is a shot that does not reach the current flat top as designed, or that is terminated in a unplanned manner in cases with no planned flat top (e.g., in case of a ramp-up disruption study).
